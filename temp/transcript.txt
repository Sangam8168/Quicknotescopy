So where are you at, Apoorva? How are things with you? I've been single for a while. What's it like? Are you going on dates or are you just focusing on your career? Those are the only dates I get. The ones I get from court. So what's going on? Are you going out on dates at all? No. Not at all. Actually, the last guy I dated, he used to speak in English which was really weird for me because I've only dated, like, Delhi boys, West Delhi boys. Westside. She is blabbering. Dating a West Delhi guy, West Delhi guys are wandering around and you all are getting locked in. We aren't that bad. Where was the guy from? I am from West Delhi. I know. I know it. I am from Vikaspuri. Which West Delhi boy you dated? Vikasf**puri, baby. Which place? I don't want to.. why are you threatening me? This is how West Delhi guys are. No, no, just asking. What? Just.. just politely requesting. This is West Delhi polite, guys. Would you be able to enlighten us of the location? West Delhi polite man is something please tell me, motherf** Vikasf**puri, baby. Still if you can give a hint. He used to talk very nicely with me, which was really like strange for me. He never abused me. So I was like what the f** is wrong with you? And so one day, we are fighting. So like, this English thing like, how does it make a difference? Like people can be polite in Hindi also, right? Yes. But he was polite in English to me which was even weirder, right? Right? Like for example? Like, so one day we were fighting and you know, I was getting really angry and he was like, Apoorva that's preposterous. Oh, you are dating Shashi Tharoor then say that. So he said preposterous and I was like, I am so sorry because I didn't know what the f** that meant so I went home and I Googled it and I was like, okay it means that whatever I was saying was wrong. That's what it means. And the West Delhi guys they don't say preposterous.
- Yeah. This was really strange for me because my other boyfriends would just call me ** I was like, 
- Which is very preposterous thing to say that. It's a preposterous thing. It's a preposterous thing to say. And so, he was really sweet that's the point, right? Right. And then it sort of didn't work out because he was travelling and I was travelling, then we were like, it won't work or whatever. First tell me what is preposterous? Preposterous is like, I cannot f** believe that you said such a messed up thing that's.. Yeah. It's very different. Because s** is a prostitute. Prostitute. It's a post prostitute. Sorry, sorry, so then you found this guy and Liking my stories and everything so I was like, On stories, you are showing, I've moved on, look at me. No, no, I am posting, like, oh, my God, sleeping alone but you post on your close friends. Okay. I was like, okay, if I don't get anyone, he is there. If I don't find anyone until a year, maybe I'll go back to him, I'll be like, what's up? We've a lot of common friends, right? So I met one of those common friends literally, 2 days ago, let's call her Preeti. And Preeti is like, oh, my God. Do you know what ** is doing? And I was like, what is he doing? And she's like, he's going out on a date. I am like, how dare he? I am married to him in my head, right? So like, I'm posting.. yeah. You are backup married to him. And I was so pissed off. So I was like, is she hot, is she funny, show me it was a guy. Okay. That he is going out with. That's preposterous. That's preposterous. So this, this guy, is he gay, is he bisexual, what is it? So apparently, last year he came out as bi. Five days after we broke up. So basically, he dated me and he realised yeah, f** no. Not women. And yeah, and now he is into guys. Do you feel betrayed that he didn't tell you that he is bisexual? Or he told you? No. He never told me. He told me that he is metrosexual. Which again I did not know the meaning of. And so I went back, I Googled and it's just men who are really like, in touch with their feminine side. I thought he was into DN Nagar metro. Wow. The metro is passing by. It would be fun the day it's complete. So he says that he is fashionable and he is sympathetic. That he wears pink on a daily basis. Okay, so he just said that.. Are you stereotyping that guy? That's not fair. That's preposterous. Gaurav is going to use preposterous for 15 days everyday. You will see Gaurav Kapoor's next standup special is going to be called preposterous. If my kid refuses to recognise me, I am going to say, that's preposterous, son. Gaurav just had a baby, guys. Yes. New father. GK, you are a new father. Yeah. How many months it's been? 4 months, 5 months? It's been 5 months. Amazing. So how is your relationship status changed? What's it like? It's like, we're planning whether or not to have a second kid? And if we do, we want a girl. So we are contemplating adoption whether or not we'll do it over the period. Hang on. Some of them are like, wow, what a beautiful person he is. There are only 2 options. We're only discussing if we don't you'll abuse me in future. We are just talking. We are thinking. So where will you adopt it from? I don't know yet. The procedure is too lengthy. If you want to adopt.. On Cashify.. Cashify is selling children what? Cashify sells second-hand phones. That is not what Cashify does. I don't want the brand manager to be like, we don't sell kids. We're planning.. like we want a girl. But we've noticed. You've a son now? I've a son. You've a son now. I've a son now. We've a son now. Me and my wife have a son now. Okay. But we want second like second kid we want to be a girl. So we discuss adopting we plan whether or not we must do it. So whenever we are discussing I noticed, the first child he is 3 months old, whenever we are even thinking about it, he starts crying. The family is complete when there's a husband-wife and a son and daughter. Correct. So we want a girl. I can see it in my son's eyes slightly. He is saying no. Whole property, me only. GK, as a comic, I think about this a lot there's a lot of travelling as a comic. So you are physically not there and there's nothing you can do about it. Yeah, yeah. How do you deal with that? I mean.. I travel on weekends. Okay. Yeah, because children don't need parents on weekends. Weekdays are important. There's one parent which is always there then we help.. There's one issue when I return home after 3 days, the kid is 4 months old, he forgets me. So I have to condition him again. Okay, so he forgets on Mondays He forgets me on a Monday, then on Tuesday he remembers, this is my father. Friday, I travel again and the same process goes on on Monday. I pick him up, it's me, son. I swear. Last week I picked him up and he doesn't cry properly. If there's a problem. The kids make faces when they cry. When I go back on Monday, he will forget me. Then he is again with his mom and Japa Aunty. So your competition is Japa Aunty? He is more closer to.. in his life it's like mom, Japa and then my mother-in-law because she also stays with us and then me. And then sometimes our cook also. She also takes care. It takes a village to raise a kid. Wow. Literally, they've come from the village, Japa and cook. You guys have any nephews or any contact with babies around you in your life. For him to adopt? Huh? No, no, he is asking if you've any experience you could share so it is easier for me. Oh, okay. No, no experience. Do you guys hang out with babies? No. No, nobody is hanging out? Just manchilds. Hey, that's the name of my special. Which is on YouTube, please watch. How have you been Azeem? How have you been in your relationship? I mean.. I've a bit of an announcement to make that I got out of a long-term relationship. With Gokhale bridge. The bridge is made now. What do I talk about in my life? But no, still married, unfortunately. And completed 11 years now. Sure, if you say so. He said unfortunately, man. Why do you have to say that? That's not good, bro. I mean fortunately also. Like, we are in, it feels like a long-distance marriage right now. Because we moved to Goa last year and then we realised both of us have to keep travelling to work and we also have.. we don't have children but we've cats. So at the start of the process we both travel only one at at time. I know it's the same thing, we are also hoping we get a female cat. Does the cat recognise you on Mondays? Yeah, actually, no they give me a little attitude when I come back from touring. But then.. like Gaurav said they know who pays the bills. This is.. this is great because like I don't have a kid, I don't have cats, I've two dogs and dogs are so needy. If I come back anytime, they are like, thank you, mate. I think I've made the best decision out of all of you. So what were you saying? Sorry. No, so we end up travelling quite a lot like, we actually, met today for the first time in a month after travelling and I think in the last 3 months, we've met a total of 4 times. Now we're taking all of July off to sort of just bond, chill, relax. And spend time in Goa. Right. And.. Just in case your wife forgets you like his child forgets. Every Monday I show up, she's also Four times you've met your wife or your cat. No, my wife. Wife? I've seen my cat more than my wife at this point. You are worse than me. Very worse. But no, now we've a plot twist in our life. Which is that for a brief period of time my wife's sister is moving in with us. In our spare bedroom because we can have that in Goa. Your wife's sibling. Yeah, and she is like the youngest sibling so she is a Gen Z person. So we're going to be living with a Gen Z Are you in a position where you all are like, I don't want this and your wife is like, don't say that about my sister? Or what is it like? If I speak, I am in big trouble. So I prefer not to speak. No but listen, we all get along very well. Yeah, you must say that. I've to say that now. But now at least, there's vape available in your house. Vape? Oh, yes, correct. The one Gen Z reference that Gaurav had, he's like, I'll throw it, let's see if this sticks on the wall. No, no, not one, I've two. Okay, go on. She would've lemon grass and strawberry both. You forgot matcha. Apoorva, you are Gen Z. You are also Gen Z. Is it Gen Z? Gen Z is born after 97. I am 2001 born. Sorry, born, okay, fair enough. I am Gen Z just take my word for it. I agree. You were born after 'Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai'? Yes. Crazy. Umm.. but we're preparing for that it will be interesting to have because Gen Z people are so like in touch with their feelings and all of that. Is that so Apoorva? Is he right about this? In touch with your feelings. Yes, I am very in touch with my feelings. I am depressed 24x7. Yeah, that's pretty much the energy that I am going to have in my house right now. So depression, anxiety, ADHD, she comes with the full package. It's very nice. So it will be interesting.. I've heard even the cats are depressed. No, no, our cat is mostly happy because I am not there. You two have some sexual tension, that's cute. Is it like enemies to lovers.. Me and Azeem? We are meeting for the second time only, I think. Pretty much like my wife only. It explains the tension at this point. Do you have any siblings? Where did you get the vaping reference from? I've three siblings. Oh, wow. Oh, really? It was me and my brother and then Badhaai Ho happened in our family. Oh, wow. Two twins also we've. Then why are you adopting? Take one of them. They are there. Are you going to ask for rent for staying in your house? Of course. You've to. So I am actually drawing up like a full on contract with her and my wife because all of us have never lived with a flatmate before. So I am making a time table for chores and all of that there's a limit that you can't wake up after this time because the maid comes and has to clean your room. You are worst than Bombay landlords. Yeah. Your landlord if they are telling you what time to wake up is also very worrying. They drill. Apoorva, wake up. 8 and a half hours are done. Dude, I've had a landlord who has stayed in the same building. And basically her thing was that I lived in the house that her son was supposed to live in Because she was overbearing, her son left that house and it was empty. So I rented that house and she was like, now you are my son. And I was like, I have escaped from my mom. What the f** is this? Then Raunaq lived there for one year and then she moved away. And all this despite the fact that Raunaq's dad is a property broker in Mumbai. My dad is a real estate agent. My dad is a real estate agent and okay, you know what? F** it my dad should know everyone should know. My dad didn't help me buy the f**.. find a house.. You bought a house? No, no, I rented a house. Sorry. Okay, okay. My dad was like, if I don't help him find a house He will not find. He will stay in my house. And I was like, there are other brokers. The worst part is that for a brief amount of time that I was also a real estate agent but I used to work for my father. So all of this other brokers thought that I am calling them to steal data for my father. So they were like, I know why you are calling me. I was like, he is my enemy too, my friend. Could've said preposterous. And in future you will be bisexual. If he is into astrology this much, he is also gay. Being into astrology is gay? Are you into astrology? I am not but Are you into astrology? No, no. Are you into astrology? But I am a little gay though. Happy pride month. Okay, so the TLDR version is that this person dated someone then the person they were dating gave their information which is a huge data leak. This doesn't happen in the iPhone era. And gave.. shared information with astrologer. Amavas is a bad day, right? Basically, astrology is sort of finding the compatibility between two people using star charts whatever. It's not always two people, sometimes it's one person Yes. It sort of like, FLAMES for religious people. And now the astrologer is like, Mercury is in retrograde it means Saturn is strong. Saturn is strong, that what it means. Is Mercury and Shani the same thing? No. Not the same. Okay, what a bad guess. Tell us, tell us, somebody explain astrology to us. You are an astrologer? Okay. Most of them do it for fun only. Because there's nothing professional about. This sounds like EMI calculator. You go to a website? What a hack. Like, I mean I thought you would actually look at the stars and create a map based on telescope and all of that. So we've a guy who is an astrophysicist here. What is ISRO if not astrology with science? Does it ever happen that you are at work and someone's like, hey look Sagittarius. Is there any amount of like bullshitting that an astrologer can say ask an astrophysicist there's a data you accumulate How bullshit? You are the scientist. But my question is being an astrophysicist, how did you get time to go to Jehangir Art Gallery? Usually free people go there, you should be working. Maybe his Saturn is strong. Have you guys been to an astrologer? Yes. I fully believed in it and I was What are you? Are you a Pisces or a Taurus? I am a Leo. Any Leos in the audience. Just one, okay? Rebel adult. Sorry, sorry, tell us. What is your experience like in astrology? Umm.. so I went because I needed some answers. And she basically told me the astrologer that I've a Pitri dosh. Who? Pitri dosh, which basically translates to daddy issues. Basically, whatever dad has sinned, I've to pay for it. You are paying the sins of your father. Yes. Yes. Yes. Amazing. Wow. Pitri dosh. In science they say, petri dish which is very.. So he is saying father is responsible for everything. Yes. But this is classic therapy 101, right? That you just blame parents for everything. So going to astros is same as therapy. Astros. How? Yeah. They'll be like Oh, you are sad right now but everything gets better. Keep trying. Then they'll be like But what does it have to do with planets? Nothing. Okay. I am confused now. No, so they will tell you that this is f** Okay. Now, it's okay. It will get better so like therapy you've to work on yourself, they say, marry a tree. Please cut this. My therapist told me that will fix the problems. I don't really think stealing of birth data is very hard of Yeah you can steal it.. You ask when is your birthday. It's pretty easy. No, but you need time and place. But that's the thing, so the person dating her could have very easily asked her so it's not really stolen, it's just voluntarily given. It's like iTunes terms and conditions, you just accepted it. No, you are not understanding. He must have said, we are applying for visa, send me your birth certificate. Yeah. There is some malice to it, right? You are just sharing it out of your goodwill. Understood. Okay. So sort of like the Aadhar concept. Yeah, yeah, it's not like the Aadhar concept, they are just taking your data I love how this political reference was lost on f** all of you. But thank you. Yeah. Sorry, bro, my audience is not Gokhale bridge audience. They are regular human beings, enjoying life. Yeah, man. We're all just metrosexuals. So he must have taken all the data put it into an e-mail, written it to that guy and that guy came back and he was like, hey umm.. be careful his Mercury is in retrograde. I don't think you need to e-mail anybody. It's for 199. 199? Unlimited kundalis. What? What is this? In 199, you can get unlimited kundalis the birth chart and.. I promise you that's not what Cashify does. But the point being that Mercury was in retrograde then. It feels like this guy is fooling that girl. He was in a relationship later he broke up, he searched the historical data and he found her. Historical data of one month. I am supporting the girl. Good for West Delhi. West Delhi is moving on in life. Vikasf**puri, baby. West Delhi has always been supporting but only in Hindi. But you know, the thing is.. the thing is would you also feel like, everything is going fine but an astrologer has created a doubt that this person, their Mercury is in retrograde and your life is going to get f** Would you act on that? Yeah, I would blame them for everything after that. But I would not break up. I would keep them around and keep blaming them. Everything that's wrong, it's because of you and I am still not leaving you. That's a regular marriage. Can confirm. Wow. Okay, so would you have that doubt? No, I don't believe in such things. Has anyone put any superstition in you before? Even I don't believe it but if someone told me, I would start thinking about it. If I had.. I mean astrology.. I don't believe. Nobody told anything to you about astrology before? No. I come from a little progressive area, you know. Before we move on to the next question we just need to do a quick call out to the brand. Listen, we gotta be excited when we talk about the brand, okay? So when I saw quick brand integration, you guys should be like, what are you saying? Let's go. Full energy. So before we move on, we gotta talk about the brand. What are you saying? There's a brand's name written behind you? What? The brand's name is Cashify. Does everybody know what Cashify is? Make some noise. Who doesn't know Cashify? I think everybody watches Latent so they've heard Cashify there. I don't think we can watch Latent because of you. Which is why they were like, bro, talk about us again. And I was, like, I am calling Apoorva. And they were like, what the f** man. They were like, I hope you are not calling that Beer Biceps guy I was like, no. He is with his parents right now. Anyway. Discussing astrology. Yeah, what did you think? Cashify is an app, you've to download It's available on iOS as well as on Android. You guys have seen GK's show, you guys have seen Lie Hard? Woah. No, no, it's okay. Watch it, Later on. Yeah, okay. Everyone has got an old phone, lying around at home maybe that they think they want to get rid of but they don't get rid of it, right? Because you were too lazy or you thought this is going to be a vintage piece or whatever. You evaluate it on Cashify. Cashify will send a guy to your house and he will check. Based on the evaluation, and give you the cash there and there and take away your phone. Before we go on, we've a quick Cashify segment. We've Cashify gifts to give to people Yes, are you guys excited? Can we participate? Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, one second. We've Cashify gifts to give to people. We're gonna give the first envelope to whoever's got the lowest battery on their phone right now? Who has got the lowest battery. Check. Take your phones out. It's called phones out, cash in. I love how you are rewarding the least responsible person in this audience. Whose got? What's yours bro? 5%?
- 4%? Can we take his phone, play some videos and make sure he doesn't go home? Is there anybody less than 4%? You've two phones? You should sell one on Cashify. Here you go. Come, come, come, take it. You gotta hold it. You gotta hold it like this. You can't open it until later. Who has the longest snap streak? Who has the longest snap streak? What is your longest snap streak? What is snap streak? Snap streak is if you are on Snapchat What is Snapchat? Who are these people texting everyday? Their drug dealers? What's your snap streak? 2025. 2023? 2025, you said. Bro, you tell us. 2052. We got 2052. We got a winner ladies and gents. Woah! What's your name? Anushka has been wasting her time Anushka's parents sell her phone on Cashify. One last question, okay open your call logs who has the longest call duration that they can show us? Call duration? Nobody's got the people that they love. That they talk to for a long time. Apoorva, you must have your lawyers on there. 4:58, ladies and gentlemen. We've a winner.
Come, take your prize. Whom are you talking to? Can you show us the proof? Bro, but what were you talking? Yeah, what were you talking? 4 hours, 58 minutes 43 seconds. That's good. You deserve this, brother. You deserve this. Thank you. Could I request.. Round of applause for him. That's the end of Cashify segment. Bro, bro, bro. Can you come here? Open up the envelope and show the big prize to everybody. Big prize. Okay, this is good. Which means a woke person can be annoying but if he has a clean heart then you are with a good person at the end of the day. But she is saying, don't say guys. Then say what? People, shall we go to a party? Can work. But it's a slipper slope. If you are saying, there was a bunch of 4 guys over there. Then there's a bunch of 4 people, then there's a bunch of 4 male people but one of them did not identify as male. So then there were 3 male people and one non-binary person so it becomes a math problem by the end of the day. Is it nice to always correct people? And tell them don't say this, say it like this. No, no, I think this guy needs to date outside of Bandra. But if you love someone, you should just accept them as how they are, right? You shouldn't be correcting them all the time. Yeah but she is saying that I accept you for how you are which is why I am being empathetic to you but you are not accepting that guy is non-binary by calling him a guy. Correct? Like you need to ask people.. If there's a crazy person what do you call them? Moron. Yeah, what would you.. what would be a woke definition of a crazy person? 'Uthpathi'. Pitra dosh. What is not allowed to say anymore? What are the things that.. Would you rather.. Is that more of a woke issue or is that more of a preservative issue? That's like a smash issue. I think that's most of a post-edit issue. Yes. Absolutely. Please understand. As I said, there are live comedians and alive comedians. What kind of a stuff is woke? What kind of stuff Pronouns.. yeah you gotta ask people the pronouns. Is that big thing? In your offices.. In India, it's really not that much even in corporate culture. People are nodding when I am saying in corporate culture it is like that? Let's say, if you have said your pronouns are like, me one would assume my pronouns are he but I said my pronouns are she. Right? And someone calls me he. Can I go to HR? Yeah. I can go to HR. Even in India, HR takes it seriously? So it's like if you are working. Where do you work? Google out of all people is like, he, she. Google if you work with then of course. Yeah. What... Tthey are called FAANG? MAANG? Oh even they changed their pronouns. F is now M. I think if you've a problem hearing the word crazy, they are crazy. How can someone have a problem with the word crazy? Has someone ever dated someone who is too woke I think my wife is not as woke as I am. That day I was telling her it's too sunny, shut the visually impaired. And she was like, it's called shut the blinds. Forget woke, being corrected by your partner how does that make you feel? I mean.. in fairness, it's usually me doing the correcting but Because this is where he is, right? It's annoying but she is right. have you been corrected by your partner? Yes, a lot of times. Yeah? Like what? My English is sometimes wrong but I am confident that I am speaking correct. So once we were going somewhere and I like, they say brace yourself. So I didn't know brace I said you grace yourself. Yes, Queen, you should. And she was like, She f** me up. Pardon my language. She.. she really teased me. She told this at every party. Taunted me all the time. She still taunts me. Gaurav, you grace yourself today. I remember once I told my wife, I was supposed to say I am performing at a lounge but I said longe because sometimes people say longe. And every time we drive by a lounge, my wife is like look there's a longe. Exactly. Same thing. There's an ISRO longe here. It's cute, it's funny but it's a little like, I wish I wasn't this stupid. No, I told her I meant grace yourself. Really. You've to be gracious to yourself. Yeah. It's called self-love. I went to therapy. Have you been ever corrected by your partner about something? What me? I've never been corrected. I am a woman. I always keep correcting my boyfriend like, last time I told him don't f** other women. He didn't listen to me so he started f** men. Oh. Nice. Now that you are talking about your wife We spoke about this earlier. I really appreciate I really appreciate. So Gaurav and I have been friends for quite some time. Gaurav and I've been friends and then in the middle Yeah. in the middle.. should I tell them? Yeah, tell them. In the middle, I felt something was up because I was offended because I found out that Gaurav unfollowed me on Instagram. And this is after he moved to Delhi and he got successful and I was like, Oh, this guy is f** unfollowed me. So.. You also unfollowed me. Then I unfollowed you back. And for many years, every time we met, he was like, bro, when are you calling me on Relationshit? And I was like, oh, he is pretending to be friends. Yeah, I am sure you've some beef with me because you unfollowed me. And it seems a little hostile. Because there are other comics whom you still follow. So I know that Nishant Suri is still your friend. And Nishant Tanwar is your friend but I must have done something. And then he told me what happened. What happened.. 4-5 years ago because of because I used to feel jealous of every other comedian so I used to vent out to my wife, like, how is he doing well? So she took my phone and unfollowed all my comedian friends. All of them. And I didn't know this for a long time because I was living my regular life. Then I was like, where is Nishant nowadays? Is he dead? Then I checked, unfollowed. I used to follow him, how have I unfollowed him? I followed him back. Then I realised Amit Tandon is also missing. Don't know where he is. Then I searched him, I realised he has also been unfollowed. Then I realised all my comedians have been unfollowed. Then my wife told me I unfollowed everyone. Then I was following everyone back whoever I could find. I didn't remember Raunaq. Oh. Wait, I'm gonna go check now. That's preposterous. Moment of truth. No. No. Azeem
- Gaurav Kapoor Azeem, I follow you. I am your fan. Azeem, does he follow you? Moment of truth. Yes, Azeem, I follow you. Oh, I am searching my own name. I follow everyone on this A** you are following everyone. No, I follow everyone. I follow Apoorva also. I follow Azeem also. Gaurav Kapoor. It's.. Apoorva, check. He is following you guys too. Excuse me. There is a blue follow button. Oh, sorry. I am not following you. By the way, guys, we've a brand so we got.. we got a cushioned seats because You know in the comments, every time I read just saying Bro Raunaq, they are sitting very uncomfortably. This is damn good. Once one guy DMed me saying, I can't believe you made Vidya Balan also sit on that shit. So now we use brand money to get But it's good, we should be uncomfortable We should be uncomfortable. Because that's the metaphor for most relationships. Oh. Okay, change his chair, please.
